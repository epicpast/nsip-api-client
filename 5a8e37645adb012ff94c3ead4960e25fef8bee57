User requested full remediation across all severities and categories
## Context
User explicitly selected Critical + High + Medium + Low severities, and Performance + Architecture + Code Quality + Documentation categories - effectively requesting complete remediation.

## Rationale
- User wants comprehensive code improvements
- Will prioritize CRITICAL first, then HIGH, then by category
- Full verification with tests + linters will be run
- Changes will remain uncommitted for review
