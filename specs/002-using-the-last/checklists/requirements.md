# Specification Quality Checklist: Claude Code Plugin Distribution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on user workflows (plugin installation, slash commands, credential configuration)
- No programming languages, frameworks, or implementation details mentioned
- Written from user perspective (what they can do, not how it's built)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope & Boundaries) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- All 15 functional requirements are testable (e.g., "Plugin MUST expose all 10 NSIP MCP tools when active" can be verified by listing tools)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "install in under 2 minutes", "80% reduction in setup time", "90% of users succeed on first attempt")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes like "install and use tools in under 2 minutes" rather than technical metrics)
- 4 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios (total 14 Given-When-Then scenarios)
- Edge cases identified covering error handling, conflicts, updates, and toggling behavior
- Scope clearly defines what's included and excluded
- Dependencies (Python 3.10+, NSIP API, GitHub) and assumptions (Claude Code plugin support, credential availability) documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios (e.g., FR-001 metadata requirement → User Story 4 marketplace discovery)
- User scenarios progress logically: P1 (installation) → P2 (usage + config) → P3 (discovery)
- All success criteria are achievable and verifiable (installation time, tool availability, feature parity across platforms)
- Specification remains purely about user needs without leaking implementation details

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation artifacts.
