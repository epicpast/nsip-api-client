# Specification Quality Checklist: Context-Efficient API-to-MCP Gateway

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Iteration 1 - Initial Review (2025-10-11)

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated:

1. **Content Quality**:
   - ✅ Specification focuses on "what" and "why", avoiding "how" implementation details
   - ✅ Written in business language focusing on user/developer needs
   - ✅ Accessible to non-technical stakeholders
   - ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies, Constraints, Out of Scope) are complete

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (all requirements are well-defined with reasonable defaults)
   - ✅ All 15 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by verifying MCP tool format compliance)
   - ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "5 seconds", "70% smaller", "95% of invalid requests")
   - ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "LLM clients can discover operations" not "FastMCP decorator exposes functions")
   - ✅ Four prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios defined
   - ✅ Seven edge cases identified with expected behaviors
   - ✅ Scope clearly defined through Out of Scope section (14 items explicitly excluded)
   - ✅ Comprehensive dependencies (8 items) and assumptions (10 items) documented

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - ✅ Each functional requirement is actionable and has implicit acceptance criteria
   - ✅ User scenarios progress from basic (P1: discovery/invocation) to advanced (P4: orchestration)
   - ✅ Success criteria align with user scenarios and provide measurable targets
   - ✅ Specification maintains abstraction without mentioning Python, FastMCP, uv, or other implementation technologies

### Clarification Status

**No clarifications needed.** The specification uses informed assumptions based on:
- Industry-standard API patterns (REST, OpenAPI, standard auth methods)
- Common MCP use cases (LLM-to-API integration)
- Typical performance expectations for API gateways
- Standard security and operational practices

All assumptions are documented in the Assumptions section for transparency.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if user wants to explore alternatives) or `/speckit.plan` (to begin implementation planning)
- The user's original request mentioned specific technologies (python3, uv/uvx, fastMCP) which are appropriately reserved for the implementation phase, not the specification
- Context efficiency is treated as a core requirement throughout the spec, reflected in Success Criteria SC-002 and User Story 2
