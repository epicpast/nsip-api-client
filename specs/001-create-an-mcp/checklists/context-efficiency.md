- [ ] CHK023 - Are requirements specified for auto-generating tool descriptions from NSIPClient? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK024 - Is the source of "API documentation or schema definitions" (FR-002) specified for NSIPClient? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK025 - Are requirements defined for parameter validation schemas in tool definitions? [Gap]

## Multi-Transport Configuration Requirements

### Transport Mechanism Clarity

- [ ] CHK032 - Are requirements defined for connection limits per transport type? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK033 - Is "without degradation" (SC-005) quantified with specific performance thresholds? [Measurability, Spec §SC-005]

## Cache & Optimization Requirements

### Cache Behavior

- [ ] CHK034 - Are cache key generation requirements specified (what makes responses unique)? [Gap, Entity: Response Cache]
