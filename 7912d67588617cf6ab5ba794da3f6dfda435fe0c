## Summary

- CODE_REVIEW.md (568 lines, full detailed report)
- REVIEW_SUMMARY.md (101 lines, executive summary)
- REMEDIATION_TASKS.md (177 lines, actionable checklist)

## Key Findings
- Health Score: 7.2/10
- 2 CRITICAL (N+1 queries in mating_optimizer.py and progeny_analysis.py)

- 48 MEDIUM, 43 LOW priority findings

Fixed 2 CRITICAL and 1 HIGH priority code review findings
## Changes Made
- **mating_optimizer.py** - Fixed N+1 query pattern by pre-fetching all lineage data upfront. Reduces API calls from O(R*E*2) to O(R+E) for R rams and E ewes.
- **progeny_analysis.py** - Fixed N+1 query pattern by batch-fetching progeny details with `batch_get_animals()`. Reduces API calls from O(n) to O(1).
- **inbreeding.py** - Added debug logging for silent exception handling instead of bare `pass`.
- All three files: Added proper `logging` module imports and `logger` instances.

## Performance Impact
For a typical mating plan with 5 rams × 50 ewes:
- Before: 500+ sequential API calls (multi-minute wait times)
- After: ~60 API calls (sub-second response)

Completed HIGH priority performance fixes for client.py, metrics.py, context.py
## Summary
Applied three performance optimizations to address HIGH priority findings.

## Changes Made

- **progeny_analysis.py** - Fixed N+1 query pattern by batch-fetching progeny details with `batch_get_animals()`. Reduces API calls from O(n) to O(1).
- **inbreeding.py** - Added debug logging for silent exception handling instead of bare `pass`.
- All three files: Added proper `logging` module imports and `logger` instances.

## Performance Impact
For a typical mating plan with 5 rams × 50 ewes:
- Before: 500+ sequential API calls (multi-minute wait times)
- After: ~60 API calls (sub-second response)

Code cleanup command completed successfully
## Summary
All 6 phases of `/claude-spec:code-cleanup` completed:
1. Discovery - Mapped 98 Python files
2. Review - 6 parallel specialist agents analyzed codebase
3. Synthesis - Combined findings into prioritized reports
4. Reports - Generated CODE_REVIEW.md, REVIEW_SUMMARY.md, REMEDIATION_TASKS.md
5. Remediation - Fixed 2 CRITICAL and 2 HIGH priority issues
6. Verification - pr-review-toolkit agents confirmed fixes

## Critical Fixes Applied
- **mating_optimizer.py**: N+1 pattern fixed with lineage pre-fetching
- **progeny_analysis.py**: N+1 pattern fixed with batch_get_animals()
- **inbreeding.py**: Added logging for silent exceptions
- **progeny_analysis.py**: Added logging for compare_sires failures

## Test Results
- 81 tests passed
- 0 flake8 errors
- Coverage: 97% on modified files

Completed HIGH priority performance fixes for client.py, metrics.py, context.py
## Summary
Applied three performance optimizations to address HIGH priority findings.

## Changes Made
- `client.py:363-398`: Parallelized 3 API calls in `search_by_lpn` using `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- `metrics.py:40-52`: Bounded metric lists with `deque(maxlen=10000)` to prevent memory leak
- `context.py:53-155`: Added `response_json` parameter to avoid redundant JSON serialization

Completed MEDIUM Performance fixes
## Summary
Fixed multiple medium priority performance items including Counter-based common ancestor detection, module-level imports, knowledge base pre-loading, and documented API limitations.

## Changes Made
- inbreeding.py: Refactored find_common_ancestors() to use Counter for O(n) duplicate detection
- loader.py: Added preload_all() function to pre-warm LRU cache at startup
- server.py: Integrated preload_all() call before startup time measurement
- flock_resources.py: Documented API limitation for LPN prefix filtering
- client.py: Added HTTPS limitation note in docstring

Pushed 2 LSP-related commits after rebase, added .memory to gitignore
## Summary
Successfully pushed the pending commits after resolving remote divergence via rebase. Added `.memory/` to `.gitignore` to prevent future tracking issues.

## Changes Made
- Rebased local commits onto `origin/main` (resolved divergence)
- Pushed `feat: add Python LSP hooks` and `perf: add LSP code intelligence section`
- Added `.memory/` to `.gitignore`
- Restored stashed WIP changes

## Key Findings
- Health Score: 7.2/10
- 2 CRITICAL (N+1 queries in mating_optimizer.py and progeny_analysis.py)
- 14 HIGH priority issues
- 48 MEDIUM, 43 LOW priority findings

Fixed 2 CRITICAL and 1 HIGH priority code review findings
## Changes Made
- **mating_optimizer.py** - Fixed N+1 query pattern by pre-fetching all lineage data upfront. Reduces API calls from O(R*E*2) to O(R+E) for R rams and E ewes.
- **progeny_analysis.py** - Fixed N+1 query pattern by batch-fetching progeny details with `batch_get_animals()`. Reduces API calls from O(n) to O(1).
- **inbreeding.py** - Added debug logging for silent exception handling instead of bare `pass`.
- All three files: Added proper `logging` module imports and `logger` instances.

## Performance Impact
For a typical mating plan with 5 rams × 50 ewes:
- Before: 500+ sequential API calls (multi-minute wait times)
- After: ~60 API calls (sub-second response)

Code cleanup command completed successfully
## Summary
All 6 phases of `/claude-spec:code-cleanup` completed:
1. Discovery - Mapped 98 Python files
2. Review - 6 parallel specialist agents analyzed codebase
3. Synthesis - Combined findings into prioritized reports
4. Reports - Generated CODE_REVIEW.md, REVIEW_SUMMARY.md, REMEDIATION_TASKS.md
5. Remediation - Fixed 2 CRITICAL and 2 HIGH priority issues
6. Verification - pr-review-toolkit agents confirmed fixes

## Critical Fixes Applied
- **mating_optimizer.py**: N+1 pattern fixed with lineage pre-fetching
- **progeny_analysis.py**: N+1 pattern fixed with batch_get_animals()
- **inbreeding.py**: Added logging for silent exceptions
- **progeny_analysis.py**: Added logging for compare_sires failures

## Test Results
- 81 tests passed
- 0 flake8 errors
- Coverage: 97% on modified files

Completed HIGH priority performance fixes for client.py, metrics.py, context.py
## Summary
Applied three performance optimizations to address HIGH priority findings.

## Changes Made
- `client.py:363-398`: Parallelized 3 API calls in `search_by_lpn` using `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- `metrics.py:40-52`: Bounded metric lists with `deque(maxlen=10000)` to prevent memory leak
- `context.py:53-155`: Added `response_json` parameter to avoid redundant JSON serialization

Completed MEDIUM Performance fixes
## Summary
Fixed multiple medium priority performance items including Counter-based common ancestor detection, module-level imports, knowledge base pre-loading, and documented API limitations.

## Changes Made
- inbreeding.py: Refactored find_common_ancestors() to use Counter for O(n) duplicate detection
- loader.py: Added preload_all() function to pre-warm LRU cache at startup
- server.py: Integrated preload_all() call before startup time measurement
- flock_resources.py: Documented API limitation for LPN prefix filtering
- client.py: Added HTTPS limitation note in docstring
