NSIP API does not support HTTPS - SSL certificate mismatch
## Summary
Investigation confirmed the NSIP Search API (nsipsearch.nsip.org) does not have valid HTTPS support. Certificate subject name mismatch prevents secure connections.

## Technical Details
- SSL Error: "no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name"
- This is an upstream service limitation, not fixable in client code
- HTTP works correctly (Microsoft-IIS/10.0)
