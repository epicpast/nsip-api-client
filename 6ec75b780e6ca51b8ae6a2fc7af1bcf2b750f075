Addressed verification feedback from pr-review-toolkit agents
## Key Issues Found

### HIGH Priority (addressed now)
1. **compare_sires silent skip** - No logging when sires fail to analyze
2. **lineage_cache dead parameter** - Passed but never used (caching happens at CachedNSIPClient level)

### MEDIUM Priority (noted for backlog)
1. Debug-level logging may be invisible in production
2. Broad exception catching with fallback to coi=0.0 could mislead users

## Decision
- Fix the silent skip in compare_sires by adding logging
- Document the lineage_cache as deprecated but keep for API compatibility (breaking change otherwise)
- Leave the broader improvements for a follow-up PR
